# Handoff Schema -- Structural Evidence Requirements

Every phase transition requires specific evidence fields. Missing fields
block the handoff. This is structural enforcement -- the absence of
evidence is itself a signal that the phase was not completed correctly.

## RED -> DOMAIN Handoff

Required fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `test_file` | Absolute path to the test file created or modified |
| `test_name` | Name of the specific test function or case |
| `failure_output` | Actual test runner output, pasted verbatim |

`failure_output` must be real output from the test runner. "I expect it
to fail" or "the test should fail" is not evidence. Compilation errors
are valid failure output.

## DOMAIN (post-RED) -> GREEN Handoff

Required fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `domain_review` | `APPROVED` or `REVISED` (with explanation of revision) |
| `type_files_created` | List of type definition files created or modified (may be empty if no new types needed) |

If `domain_review` is `REVISED`, the revision explanation must include
what was changed and why. The RED agent must re-run the test and provide
updated failure output before the handoff proceeds.

## GREEN -> DOMAIN (post-GREEN) Handoff

Required fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `implementation_files` | List of production files created or modified |
| `test_output` | Actual test runner output showing the test now passes |

`test_output` must show the specific test passing. "Tests should pass
now" is not evidence.

## DOMAIN (post-GREEN) -> COMMIT Handoff

Required fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `review` | `APPROVED` or `CONCERN_RAISED` (with specific concern and proposed alternative) |
| `full_test_output` | Full test suite output, not just the single test |

If `review` is `CONCERN_RAISED`, the concern must be resolved before
proceeding to COMMIT. The implementation is revised via the GREEN phase,
then domain reviews again.

## Enforcement by Mode

**Automated mode (serial subagents):** The orchestrator checks return
values against this schema before dispatching the next phase agent. A
missing field means the orchestrator re-prompts the current agent for
the missing evidence.

**Automated mode (agent teams):** Engineers include these fields in
their structured handoff messages. The orchestrator monitors handoff
completeness.

**Guided mode:** The skill text prompts the user to provide this
evidence at each phase transition. The user is responsible for verifying
completeness before advancing.

**Chaining mode:** The agent self-checks against this schema before
switching roles to the next phase.
