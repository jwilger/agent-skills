# Mob Review Protocol

Full-team review process for the PR phase. Triggers after a pair completes their
TDD cycle and the code is ready for merge. Integrates the three-stage code review
(from the parent skill) with consent-based decision-making from Robert's Rules.

## Participants

The full team reviews every PR. The same consent-by-default Robert's Rules protocol
used in planning applies here. Members who lack relevant expertise for a given stage
should **stand aside** -- this is appropriate deference, not disapproval. The
accessibility specialist does not need to opine on database internals; the domain
SME does not need to review CSS.

## Stage Leadership

Each review stage has designated leads. Other team members may contribute to any
stage but are not required to.

| Stage | Focus | Led By |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 -- Spec Compliance | Does the code do what was asked? | PM and domain SME |
| 2 -- Code Quality | Is it clear, tested, maintainable? | Engineers NOT in the original pair |
| 3 -- Domain Integrity | Are domain boundaries respected? | Domain SME with input from all |

Stages run sequentially. A failure in an earlier stage blocks later stages, per the
parent skill's rules.

## Decision Categories

Feedback items are classified the same way as planning decisions:

| Category | Examples | Max Rounds | Quorum |
|----------|----------|------------|--------|
| Trivial | Naming, formatting, minor style | 1 | 5 of 8 (consent-by-default) |
| Standard | Architecture, API changes | 3 | 6 of 8 |
| Critical | Security, breaking changes | 5 | 8 of 8 (full quorum) |

The facilitator classifies each feedback item. Trivial items adopt automatically
if no objection is raised within the round.

## Feedback Resolution

The original pair addresses all feedback using their existing ping-pong process.
If feedback requires significant rework, pair rotation rules still apply -- the
pairing history constraint (no repeat of last 2 pairings) may assign a new pair.

## Re-review

After feedback is addressed, only affected reviewers re-review their specific
flagged concerns. Full re-review of all stages is not required unless any change
was classified as critical-category.

## Context Budget

During mob review, team members use their **compressed active-context persona**
(<500 tokens), not full profiles. Full profiles are loaded only for the engineers
doing the fix work. This keeps the review phase lightweight on context while
preserving persona-consistent judgment.

## Factory Mode Review

In factory mode, the mob review serves as the critical pre-push quality
checkpoint. The pipeline invokes mob review AFTER TDD is complete but BEFORE
pushing code. All three stages still apply (spec compliance, code quality,
domain integrity).

**Key differences from supervised mode:**

- Review is triggered automatically by the pipeline, not by the coordinator
- Team members use compressed persona forms during review (same as supervised
  mode)
- Review findings are classified: **blocking** (must fix before push),
  **non-blocking** (batch for later)
- Blocking findings route back to the TDD pair for immediate rework
- Non-blocking findings are recorded in the audit trail for the next human
  review cycle
- The review stage does NOT use Robert's Rules consensus -- findings are
  factual observations, not motions to debate

**REVIEW_RESULT evidence:**

- Per-stage: `{stage_name, verdict (PASS/FAIL), findings[]}`
- Finding: `{severity (blocking/non-blocking/informational), description,
  file, line?, required_change?}`
- Overall verdict: PASS only if all three stages PASS and zero blocking
  findings remain unaddressed
- Stored at `.factory/audit-trail/slices/<slice-id>/review.json`

## Verification

After completing a mob review, verify:

- [ ] All three stages were performed sequentially with designated leads
- [ ] Stand-asides were recorded, not treated as blocks
- [ ] Each feedback item was classified by decision category
- [ ] Trivial items used consent-by-default (1 round)
- [ ] Critical items achieved full quorum before adopting
- [ ] Original pair addressed feedback via ping-pong process
- [ ] Re-review was scoped to flagged concerns only (unless critical)
- [ ] Team members used compressed persona forms during review
