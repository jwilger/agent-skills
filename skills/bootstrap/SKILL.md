# Bootstrap

**Value:** Communication -- establish shared understanding of environment,
capabilities, and workflow before any work begins.

## Purpose

Single entry point for configuring the SDLC workflow on any harness. Detects
the project environment and harness capabilities, configures TDD mode
(guided or automated), generates harness-appropriate instruction files, and
recommends skills. Never silently installs or modifies anything.

## Practices

### Step 1: Detect the Environment

Gather project context silently before asking questions:

```
!test -f package.json && echo "js" || true
!test -f Cargo.toml && echo "rust" || true
!test -f pyproject.toml && echo "python" || true
!test -f go.mod && echo "go" || true
!test -f mix.exs && echo "elixir" || true
!git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null && echo "git" || true
!ls skills/*/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null | sed 's|skills/||;s|/SKILL.md||' || true
```

Record: languages detected, git available, skills already installed.

### Step 2: Detect Harness Capabilities

Probe for delegation primitives. See `references/capability-detection.md`
for the full detection procedure.

| Capability | How to detect | Implication |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Skill chaining | Always available | Guided TDD mode works |
| Subagents | Task tool present | Serial subagent strategy works |
| Agent teams | TeamCreate tool present | Ping-pong pairing works |

### Step 3: Detect Harness Type

Identify the harness to generate the correct instruction files:

| Signal | Harness |
|--------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` convention, Claude Code tools | Claude Code |
| `AGENTS.md` convention, Codex tools | Codex |
| `.cursor/rules` directory | Cursor / Windsurf |
| None of the above | Generic (AGENTS.md only) |

### Step 4: Configure TDD Mode

Recommend based on detected capabilities:

- **Subagents or teams available:** Recommend automated mode (`/tdd`).
- **No delegation primitives:** Recommend guided mode (`/tdd red`, `/tdd green`, etc.).
- Let the user override. Record the choice.

If Claude Code is detected and the user wants maximum enforcement, offer
to install optional hook templates from `skills/tdd/references/hooks/`.

### Step 4b: Detect Factory Mode

Check if the `pipeline` skill is installed (`skills/pipeline/SKILL.md` exists). If detected, factory pipeline mode is available and Step 5 includes an additional question.

### Step 5: Ask the User

**Question 1: What are you trying to do?**
- "Start a new project" -- recommend Understand + Decide + Build phases
- "Add a feature or fix a bug" -- recommend Build + Ship phases
- "Set up team workflow" -- recommend all phases plus ensemble team

**Question 2: How much process structure?**
- "Minimal" -- recommend tdd, domain-modeling
- "Standard" -- recommend core + ship skills
- "Full" -- recommend all skills (include factory pipeline skills when pipeline is detected)

**Question 3 (only when pipeline skill is detected): What autonomy level?**
- "Conservative" (default for new projects) -- human approval at every gate
- "Standard" (established projects) -- human approval at PR and deploy gates only
- "Full" (mature projects with comprehensive tests) -- human approval at deploy gate only

When this question is answered, generate `.factory/config.yaml` with the chosen autonomy level and sensible defaults (e.g., max rework cycles, slice timeout, audit trail path).

See `references/skill-recommendations.md` for the full skill list by phase.

### Step 6: Generate Instruction Files

Generate harness-appropriate files. See `references/agents-md.md` for
AGENTS.md best practices (small routing document, progressive disclosure,
managed markers) and `references/harness-files.md` for harness-specific
generation rules.

### Step 7: Optional Ensemble Team

If the user selected "Set up team workflow" or "Full" process structure,
offer to invoke the `ensemble-team` skill for AI team formation. Present
the three presets (solo-plus, lean, full). If accepted, invoke the skill
and record the preset in configuration.

### Step 8: Commit and Display

Stage generated files, commit with a descriptive message, and display:
- What was configured (harness, TDD mode, skills recommended)
- Next steps (`/tdd` to start a TDD cycle, or phase-specific commands)
- If ensemble team was configured, note the preset and member count

## Enforcement Note

This skill is purely advisory. It generates configuration and instruction
files but cannot install skills or modify harness settings without user
confirmation.

## Verification

- [ ] Environment was detected before asking questions
- [ ] Harness capabilities were probed (not assumed)
- [ ] No more than 2-3 questions were asked
- [ ] TDD mode recommendation matched detected capabilities
- [ ] Generated files use managed markers for safe re-runs
- [ ] Nothing was installed without user confirmation

## Dependencies

This skill works standalone. It recommends but does not require other skills.
It generates configuration that references the `tdd` skill for TDD workflow.
