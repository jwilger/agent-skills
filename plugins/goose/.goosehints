This project follows a structured software development lifecycle using
agent skills from jwilger/agent-skills.

## Workflow: Test-Driven Development

All code changes follow the red/domain/green/domain cycle:

1. RED: Write ONE failing test. Run it. Verify it fails. Stop.
2. DOMAIN: Review for primitive obsession. Create types with stubs. Stop.
3. GREEN: Minimal implementation to pass the test. Run it. Verify it passes. Stop.
4. DOMAIN: Review implementation for domain violations. Stop.

Phase boundaries: RED edits only test files, DOMAIN edits only type
definitions, GREEN edits only implementation code.

## Domain Modeling

Use domain types, not primitives. Email not String, Money not float.
Parse at the boundary, trust types internally. Make invalid states
unrepresentable. Name types for what they ARE in the domain, not what
they are made of (UserName not NonEmptyString).

## Architecture

Check for docs/ARCHITECTURE.md before making structural changes. If it
exists, follow documented decisions. Record new architecture decisions
in docs/adr/ using the ADR format.

## Code Review

Before creating a PR, verify three stages:
1. Spec compliance: every criterion has a test
2. Code quality: no dead code, duplication, or complexity
3. Domain integrity: no primitive obsession, types enforce invariants

## Testing

Always run tests and paste the actual output. Never assume a test will
pass or fail. One assertion per test. Commit after each completed cycle.

## Recipes

SDLC workflow recipes are available in the recipes/ directory:
- tdd-cycle.yaml: Red/domain/green/domain implementation workflow
- event-modeling.yaml: Domain discovery and modeling session
- code-review.yaml: Three-stage review protocol
- pr-workflow.yaml: PR creation with quality gates

Run a recipe with: goose run --recipe recipes/<name>.yaml
